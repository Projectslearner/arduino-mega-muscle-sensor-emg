# Muscle Sensor EMG

#### Project Overview

The Muscle Sensor EMG project demonstrates how to interface an EMG sensor with an Arduino Mega to monitor muscle activity. The EMG sensor converts muscle electrical signals into voltage variations, which are then read by the Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This project reads the EMG sensor values and prints them to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Muscle Sensor EMG Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Muscle Sensor EMG Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - **EMG Signal Pin**: Connect to analog pin A0 on Arduino Mega.
   - **Power (VCC)**: Connect to 5V pin on Arduino Mega.
   - **Ground (GND)**: Connect to GND pin on Arduino Mega.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Muscle Sensor EMG Module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for EMG sensor value readings.
   - Perform muscle contractions or relaxations to see changes in sensor values.

#### Applications

- **Physical Rehabilitation:** Monitor muscle activity during therapy sessions.
- **Sports Science:** Analyze muscle performance and fatigue.
- **Prosthetics and Robotics:** Control movements based on muscle signals.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper placement of the EMG sensor on the muscle of interest.
- Calibrate readings based on sensor sensitivity and muscle activity levels.
- Experiment with different signal processing techniques to extract useful information from EMG signals.
